# TeachMePCB.com

I'm taking the TeachMePCB.com introduction to PCB design course.
(As of this writing it is definitely recommended.)

This repo is:
 * A cache for my files as I work on them
 * A single reference set for the datasheets of the products I'm using
 * A spot where people can point out (what I'm sure are obvious) bugs
 * A reference for others who may be looking for more info

## IMPORTANT NOTE

I am NOT an electrical engineer.
I am a software engineer.
Because of this, use these files AT YOUR OWN RISK.
